          If anything needs to be done, go all in or do not do anything at all.
          There is no point in doing something half way. It's wasted effort that
          could have been directed to what really matters. We are wired to think
          we can do many things at once. However, we are really bad at something
          that makes us feel good about ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you: eliminate all distractions, only focus on the task at hand,
          and apply a growth mindset, you can accomplish things you never
          thought possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only thing that it will cost you is your time and effort. You have
          the ability to increase your capacity for effort, but you cannot get
          more time. Yes you can increase your lifespan to a certain extent by
          maintain good health. However, pales in comparison to how much you can
          increase other things in you life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have dedicated my time and effort to achieving things I never
          thought possible.

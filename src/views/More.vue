          If anything needs to be done, go all in or do not do anything at all.
          There is no point in doing something half way. It is wasted effort
          that could have been directed to what really matters. We are wired to
          think we can do many things at once. However, we are really bad at
          something that makes us feel good about ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you: eliminate all distractions, only focus on the task at hand,
          and apply a growth mindset, you can accomplish things you never
          thought possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only thing that it will cost you is your time and effort. You have
          the ability to increase your capacity to expend effort, but you cannot
          get more time. Yes, you can increase your lifespan to a certain extent
          by maintain good health. However, pales in comparison to how much you
          can increase other things in you life.

          I have dedicated my time and effort to achieving things I never
          thought possible. This in turn has made me really good at the things I
          deem valuable. I am also aware that almost every other person also
          thinks that they are greatest at what they do. So my standpoint is not
          unique. However, what set me apart from others my capacity to finish
          really difficult things. Tasks that take an amazing amount of time,
          effort, and persistence.

          If you want to see what I am talking about. Take a look at how I've
          spent my time via my SOGoS history dashboard. For fun, choose a random
          day in my past and just look at what an average day for me contains.
